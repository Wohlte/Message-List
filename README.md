# Message-List

Message-List is a simple online application I am developing that is intended to take form information, and save it in a list of messages displayed to the user. It can serve as a task list, grocery list, or any other form of list.

This project is coded in HTML/CSS/Javascript. I am currently working on developing the project in React.js, and adding additional functionality such as importance, and enhancing the aesthetic design of the website.
