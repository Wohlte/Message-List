This List Application is a simple online application I am developing as a course project. It takes form data, and saves it in a list of messages displayed to the user. It can serve as a task list, grocery list, or any other form of list. 

========

The project has been implemented in various versions:
- Javascript/HTML/CSS
- React.js with Redux
- Node.js

========

This project is coded in HTML/CSS/Javascript and React.js. I am currently working on developing the project using Node.js, and adding additional functionality such as importance, and enhancing the aesthetic design of the website.
